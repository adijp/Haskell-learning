Infix operator associates to the right while function application is left associative
Each typeclass offers a standard set of functions that can be used across several concrete types
One can often force a polymorhphic type variable to a concrete type variable by adding :: followed by the name of the concret type
eg: type of 13 is Num which is a polymorphic type, but type of 13::Integer is Integer (Concrete type)

A type system defines the associations between different parts of a program and checks that all the parts fit together in 
a logically consistent, provably correct way. 

Typechecking occurs at compile time. 

Good type systems can also enable compiler optimizations, because the compiler can know and predict certain things about the 
execution of a program based on the types.
